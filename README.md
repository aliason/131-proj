# Loan-Prediction-Project


The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the loan eligibility of customers based on information provided in their application profile. I will be using open-source data pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset 
), which can be traced back to an [Analytics Vidhya Hackathon]( https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-loan-prediction-iii/#ProblemStatement) and implementing multiple techniques to yield the most accurate model for the problem. 

Loans are a important requirement of the modern world, allowing students to cover educational expenses, businesses to grow, and banks to operate. Banks have many factors to consider when determining whether an applicant qualifies for a loan; they would arguably want to automate this process. So, we will be using machine learning techniques to predict whether a customerâ€™s profile is relevant to their eligibility based on characteristics such as Education, Gender, Matrital Status, Income, and more.
